# Matrix Factorization
## by Tejas Gupta (@tejasg)

Uses stochastic gradient descent to find factors of a 2D numpy array M
of size m x n given the O, observed entries in the array, and d, the 
embedding dimension which may correspond to the number of desired 
features in the factorization.

See `test_matrix_factorization.py` for example usage.
