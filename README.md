# Matrix Factorization
## by Tejas Gupta (@tejasg)

Uses stochastic gradient descent to find factors of a 2D numpy array M of size m x n given the O, observed entries in the array, and d, the embedding dimension which may correspond to the number of desired features in the factorization.

See `test_matrix_factorization.py` for example usage. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_factorization_(recommender_systems)) article and [Google Developer Documentation](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation/collaborative/matrix) for usage in  recommender systems.
